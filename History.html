        <h3>The BGYC QUESTION</h3>
       
     
          During my formative years as a student of the jazz discipline, 
          I acquired many lessons and insights into jazz not just as a discipline but also as a philosophy.
          Jazz was able to go far beyond my musical and technical expression. Jazz manifested itself into my everyday life, into my perspective,
          into my understanding of the world and my desire for community. I learnt so much more about myself in the very few years of study than 
          I had in all my life encounters. Thus I began the pursuit of unpacking and understanding my journey with more intentionality. 
          The questions which kept circling were: how had my lived experience impacted on my general understanding of my position in the world?
          How have I been able to cultivate a unique voice as a jazz singer? 
          What fueled and inspired me to keep questioning not only my music but my world?

        <h3>THE BGYC IMPACT</h3>
        <p>These questions led to the development of the Bridging Gaps for Young Composers (BGYC) curriculum which
            in essence is meant to inspire young musicians to ask similar questions of themselves.
            I began researching and exploring the kinds of teaching and music educational methods
            required to inspire a young musician to ask demanding questions of themselves and of their art. 
            Questions which would eventually lead them to finding intersections between their thoughts and
            ideas and the thoughts and ideas of others around the world. Thoughts 
            which eventually lead to conversations and discourses being explored as part of the challenges, 
            critiques and insights impacting our regional and global community.

        <h3>THE BGYC AIM</h3>
  
        <p>Bridging Gaps for Young Composers (BGYC) curriculum aims to establish a
            music teaching method which develops the kind of musician who is able to think of their music practice beyond the limitations of the stage. 
            The curriculum aims to inspire musicians into industries such as engineering, medicine, technology, 
            astronomy etc by revealing the intersections of thought as the 
            fundamental foundation of the BGYC teaching method. 
            We hope to be able to bring this curriculum to more young and aspiring musicians around the world.
